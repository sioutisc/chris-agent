BANDIT Learning Agent
========================================================
Release Notes
========================================================
bandit-0-2-220305
This release works with chris-6-5-220305
--------------------------------------------------------
bandit-0-1-080305
At this stage BANDIT learns within an infinite loop and needs to be manually killed. Need to fix this such that it automatically stops after a predetermined number of iterations, say 2000 as per textbook.
Curently has all info logs enabled.
It can be seen that the optimal option in ActionOptions slowly recieves greater rewards and bubbles to the first (best) item
Testbed does not yet produce a graph summary
