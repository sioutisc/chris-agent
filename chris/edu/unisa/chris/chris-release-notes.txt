Cognitive Hybrid Reasoning Intelligent agent System - CHRIS
=============================================================
Release Notes
=============================================================
chris-0-7-220305
Fixed sluggish passive learning performance
--------------------------------------------------------
chris-0-6-220305
Added multi-stateinstance action support using the Actions beliefset
Actions now need to specify when they start and finish by adding a TRUE/FALSE
to indicate if they are active to the Actions beliefset (see Bandit.agent for example)

Next: Clean any files that are not required from the release
Add copyright and other comments in all files
--------------------------------------------------------
chris-0-5-220305
Fixed behaviour of Optional in decision stage, it now keeps activating options until one passes or they all fail, hope this is what i want
added Actions beliefset to Action stage this is in preparation of fixing the learning algorithms so that they
correctly wait for an action to finish. They currently only wait for the next stateInstance, there may be actions however that 
get multiple state updates before they complete.
--------------------------------------------------------
chris-0-4-210305
Decision stage complete.
Consequence and usefulness dropped infavour of a universal reward
Next step is to clean up events in DecisionStage
--------------------------------------------------------
chris-0-4-190305
Decision stage mostly complete and tested using Survivor agent
Procedural, Parallel, Resident, Either are all working correctly
Next step is to get Optional working, this needs a change in the currentStateInstance which must
be propagated in learningGoals and learning algorithms
--------------------------------------------------------
chris-0-3-150305
SkillControl complete
VFChange is currently based on a per-step basis, however in my notes I use a per-episode basis where the episode
change is the sum of all step changes. In that situation I would only update SkillControl at the end of an episode
and it would take effect if/when that learning goal is activated again.
--------------------------------------------------------
chris-0-2-130305
QLearning and SoftMax are completed.
Added getGoalStatus method in LearningGoal to allow a learning process to be stopped when an episode is complete.
--------------------------------------------------------
chris-0-1-080305
General structure of CHRIS is complete, SARSA/EGREEDY algorithms are tested with BANDIT and display limited working functionality.
Need to add working QLearning and Softmax.
At this stage BANDIT learns within an infinite loop and needs to be manually killed. Need to fix this such that it automatically stops after a predetermined number of iterations, say 2000 as per textbook.
